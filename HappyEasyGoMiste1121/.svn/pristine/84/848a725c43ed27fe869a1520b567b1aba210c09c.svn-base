				&bull; In the event of a Booking Cancellation, ONLY Happy Gold utilized in the booking would be refunded.

				&bull; If the booking is cancelled, the cashback earned will be reverted from your Happy Wallet account. If the cashback availed through this promotion is consumed on any other booking before cancellation, it will be deducted from the total refund due in Cash.

			<p>
				&bull; If the payment is done using Happy Wallet and Cash, cancellation charges, if any, will be deducted from the total refund due on priority basis first from Cash and then from Happy Wallet.

				&bull; In case of cancellation, the refund amount to be paid to the customer would be the amount after deducting the Happy Wallet value. For example, if Booking is done for an amount of Rs.1000 with 20% cashback. In case there is a cancellation with full refund, only Rs.800 will be returned to the bank while the Rs.200 will remain in Happy Wallet balance. This Rs.200 cannot be refunded to the bank.
